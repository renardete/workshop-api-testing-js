Thanks!\r\n\r\n#### Category\r\n\r\n[ X] Bug\r\n[ X] Enhancement\r\n\r\n#### Problem Area\r\nI was able to transform a classic page to modern page using PnP PowerShell Script.\r\nBut on the modern page the list web part does not rendered as it was on classic page.\r\nFor example, on classic page, I have a Contacts list (XSLT list view) with 2 columns,  \"Full Name\", \"Business Phone\". After transforming to modern page, the list view rendered with all columns in the Contact list, like \"Attachments, Last name, First name, Business Phone\", and also shows the full tool tab or top with \"New, Export To Excel\", \"All Items\" (drop down to switch between views) and \"See All\" link. Same thing happened with Events list view web part.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ ] Page Transformation: Error during the setup/use of the Page Transformation UI solution (did you check our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-modernization/blob/dev/Solutions/PageTransformationUI/docs/troubleshootingguide.md)?)\r\n[ ] Page Transformation: Error during the use of page transformation from PnP PowerShell\r\n[ ] Page Transformation: Error during the use of page transformation from .Net\r\n[x ] Page Transformation: Page is not looking correct after transformation\r\n[ ] Modernization Scanner: something went wrong...\r\n\r\n#### Expected or Desired Behavior\r\nExpected behavior is to add list view web part on the modern page same as on classic page.\r\nIf not, is there any PnP script to access the modern page and detect the web part and modify view definition and publish the page.\r\n\r\n#### Observed Behavior\r\n I have a Contacts list (XSLT list view) with 2 columns,  \"Full Name\", \"Business Phone\". After transforming to modern page, the list view rendered with all columns in the Contact list, like \"Attachments, Last name, First name, Business Phone\", and also shows the full tool tab or top with \"New, Export To Excel\", \"All Items\" (drop down to switch between views) and \"See All\" link. Same thing happened with Events list view web part.\r\n_If you are reporting a bug, please describe the behavior you expected to occur when performing the action. If you are making a suggestion, you can delete this section._\r\n\r\n#### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Have a custom publishing page layout.\r\n2. Have one or two list views (Contacts List, Events list, custom list with one or two columns showing)\r\n3. Cross-site transformation of this classic publishing page to modern communication site.\r\n\r\n**PnP PowerShell Script used for transformation:**\r\nConvertTo-PnPClientSidePage -Identity pagename -PublishingPage -Overwrite -TargetWebUrl  http://sourcesiteurl -PageLayoutMapping E:\\custompagelayoutmapping.xml\r\n\r\n"

The tool is not updating the lists in the target site as this tool only focuses on page transformation.\r\n\r\nThe toolbar setting should however be respected: if you've turned off the toolbar in the classic XSLT list view the modern List web part should also have the toolbar off. Note that the modern list web part only supports toolbar on/off, so not the intermediate model we have in the classic XSLT list view web part.\r\n\r\nAre you testing this with a recent version?"

Thanks!\r\n\r\n#### Category\r\n\r\n[ X] Bug\r\n[ X] Enhancement\r\n\r\n#### Problem Area\r\nI was able to transform a classic page to modern page using PnP PowerShell Script.\r\nBut on the modern page the list web part does not rendered as it was on classic page.\r\nFor example, on classic page, I have a Contacts list (XSLT list view) with 2 columns,  \"Full Name\", \"Business Phone\". After transforming to modern page, the list view rendered with all columns in the Contact list, like \"Attachments, Last name, First name, Business Phone\", and also shows the full tool tab or top with \"New, Export To Excel\", \"All Items\" (drop down to switch between views) and \"See All\" link. Same thing happened with Events list view web part.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ ] Page Transformation: Error during the setup/use of the Page Transformation UI solution (did you check our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-modernization/blob/dev/Solutions/PageTransformationUI/docs/troubleshootingguide.md)?)\r\n[ ] Page Transformation: Error during the use of page transformation from PnP PowerShell\r\n[ ] Page Transformation: Error during the use of page transformation from .Net\r\n[x ] Page Transformation: Page is not looking correct after transformation\r\n[ ] Modernization Scanner: something went wrong...\r\n\r\n#### Expected or Desired Behavior\r\nExpected behavior is to add list view web part on the modern page same as on classic page.\r\nIf not, is there any PnP script to access the modern page and detect the web part and modify view definition and publish the page.\r\n\r\n#### Observed Behavior\r\n I have a Contacts list (XSLT list view) with 2 columns,  \"Full Name\", \"Business Phone\". After transforming to modern page, the list view rendered with all columns in the Contact list, like \"Attachments, Last name, First name, Business Phone\", and also shows the full tool tab or top with \"New, Export To Excel\", \"All Items\" (drop down to switch between views) and \"See All\" link. Same thing happened with Events list view web part.\r\n_If you are reporting a bug, please describe the behavior you expected to occur when performing the action. If you are making a suggestion, you can delete this section._\r\n\r\n#### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Have a custom publishing page layout.\r\n2. Have one or two list views (Contacts List, Events list, custom list with one or two columns showing)\r\n3. Cross-site transformation of this classic publishing page to modern communication site.\r\n\r\n**PnP PowerShell Script used for transformation:**\r\nConvertTo-PnPClientSidePage -Identity pagename -PublishingPage -Overwrite -TargetWebUrl  http://sourcesiteurl -PageLayoutMapping E:\\custompagelayoutmapping.xml\r\n\r\n"

                "body": "Hi @krishnachaluvadi ,\r\n\r\nWhen you do a cross site transformation the list view mapping requires that the same view (same query, same fields shown in the view and same rowlimit) is present in the target list in the communication site. The tool is not updating the lists in the target site as this tool only focuses on page transformation.\r\n\r\nThe toolbar setting should however be respected: if you've turned off the toolbar in the classic XSLT list view the modern List web part should also have the toolbar off. Note that the modern list web part only supports toolbar on/off, so not the intermediate model we have in the classic XSLT list view web part.\r\n\r\nAre you testing this with a recent version?"
